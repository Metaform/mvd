# Rules

This document outlines the inviolable technical rules of a dataspace.

1. [Identifiers](terminology.md#identifier) can be reused across a dataspaces. For example, a participant may use the same identifier in two or more dataspaces.

2. Each [participant agent deployment](terminology.md#participant-agent-deployment) has a unique identifier. 
    
    I. If unique identifiers are used for each dataspace a participant is a member of, there must be a participant agent deployment for each identifier. 
    
    II. Multiple identifiers may be used by participant agents in a single dataspace. In this case, there must be a participant agent deployment for each identifier.

3. A dataspace has an identifier.

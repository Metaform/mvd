# Terminology

#### Identifier

An __*identifier*__ is a mechanism that establishes a unique identity of an entity in a dataspace. An identifiable dataspace entity may be (but is not limited to): a dataspace authority; a participant; a participant agent; a verifier; or a trust agent. Identifiers may be based on centralized or decentralized technologies. An example of a decentralized identifier is a [Web DID](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/).

#### Participant Agent Deployment

A __*participant agent deployment*__ consists of one or more agent runtimes that are identically configured and managed as a unit. For example, a connector deployment may consist of all connector pods running in a Kubernetes ReplicaSet.
